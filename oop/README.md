## oop_extended.py

The last file used in course, contains all the course topics, including the more complicated hermetization, abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance.
All "tricky" parts should have comments with details.

## oop_getters_setters.py

Demonstrates only how to use get* and set* as functions to handle private attributes. Good to know, but don't follow that style, use properties, explained in the first file.
